What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

For me, this assignment was extremely hard to get started on. I took csc 110 last semester, but I still found it hard to remember python, let alone use it in an object-oriented way.

I also had a really hard time with classwork in the beggining. When we first started A2 together in class, it felt very rushed and I couldn't even keep up with the physical typing of the code. Which made it hard to understand what I was writing down. And then when I went to office hours to catch up I basically had to redo everything because I never was able to process what was happening.

None of this is really meant to like blame the teachers because when I had the time to ask questions the content wasn't that hard to understand. I think I'm struggling mostly because a lot of my interests are overlapping times, which makes it hard to get help. 

Overall I'm interesting in sound engineering for Film and theatre. But logistically, I'm a film major and  take computer science course/ do technical theatre. So in one evening I could have a screening, rehearsal, and TA hours and I need to choose what I go to. I can only take so many nights off rehearsal, and I'm getting absences for missing screenings (I was able to negotiate remote screening for some dates). I'm too far into the semester to drop anything, so now I just need to be extremely diligent about managing my time. 

Luckily, in the past three days I was able to work out a plan for the semester that's much more feasible thanks to a lot of faculty members. But I think for the future I need to be more cautious about the unwritten commitements when signing up for something. 

Which is something I would recommend for anyone taking this class. Obviously the weekly hours for a 4 credit class is 10-12 hours, but for a computer science course  a lot of that time needs to be in TA or Office hours, otherwise the assignments take too long. So make sure you can make the TA hours and office hours before committing to the class.
